                I have a CASIO Graph 90+E, which is effectively an fx-CG50, which is 
                effectively a tiny little computer with a SuperH CPU. And, of course, 
                I make software for it.

                It's not even that hard to get somewhere: installing custom software is 
                a matter of dragging its binary, and maybe a couple of extra files! Even better 
                is that people <em>can</em> make their own with publicly available community SDKs 
                and tooling. I like using 
                <a href='https://git.planet-casio.com/Lephenixnoir/fxsdk'>fxSDK with gint</a>, as 
                it has support for a lot of libraries, makes your code run <em>mostly</em> separately 
                from all the OS syscall mess, and I can even

                Outside of calculators, I still think that owning a little device you can have 
                control over to do generally stupid projects <em>is</em> something worth doing, 
                even just for the hell of it.
