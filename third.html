                Turns out I had a couple of sites, and this is like the <em>third</em> one I 
                have laying around.
            </p>

                The first one actually was hosted on Github Pages (ew). I won't actively talk about 
                it, but if you were around with me in the early years of this decade (I'm so fucking 
                sorry, by the way), you might have known about it.
            </p>

                The second one, fully hosted by yours truly, was on <code>freetards.xyz</code>. Sadly, 
                I don't own the domain name anymore. To be completely fair, if I could buy it, I wouldn't.
                Not only did it bring me trouble with <em>some</em> communities (but then again I'd be in it 
                regardless, considering them), but it also doesn't really fit me anymore, so yeah.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, I feel like using that domain name in a formal context would end in disaster, so yeah?
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, you got this site, which I'm making on ShitHub Pages, again. I'm planning on moving 
                out though, because I miss server-side includes, and also: GitHub. Ew.
